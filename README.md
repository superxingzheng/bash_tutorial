# bash_tutorial
This repository contains bash scripts I creaded by following the nice turoial from linuxconfig.org [1]. In case you are looking for a get-started tutorial for bash scripting, my first suggestion will be starting with directly typing and running example scripts like the ones in this repository. Reading books about Linux shell mechanism and theories is not that useful for average Linux users. Bash and Linux usually can get you satified as long as you remember how to use the functionalities like the ones in this repository. You don't have to understand how it is realized in details for most of the time.
