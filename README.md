# bash_tutorial
This repository contains bash scripts I creaded by following the nice turoial from linuxconfig.org [1]. In case you are looking for some get-started tutorials for bash scripting, I would suggest starting with typing and running example scripts like the ones here. Reading books about Linux shell mechanism and the theories is not that helpful for average Linux users. Bash and Linux usually can get you satified as long as you remember how to use the functionalities like the ones in this repository. You don't have to understand how it is realized in details for most of the time.
